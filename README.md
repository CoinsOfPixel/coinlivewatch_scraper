# coinlivewatch_scrapper

Simple script to get data from CoinLiveWatch without any API.

You just need these libraries:

#BeautifulSoup
pip3 install bs4

#Requests
pip3 install requests

#Regex
pip3 install re

#Pandas
pip3 install pandas

....

They have an amazing API. Use their API instead of this script. 

....

I know, it's "LiveCoinWatch" and not "CoinLiveWatch". Internal joke.
